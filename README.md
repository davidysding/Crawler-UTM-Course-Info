# Crawler UTM Course Info
 This crawler scraps data from UTM's course information website, which solves the issue of the bad SEO of the website. 
The data.xls and the descript.xls are the sample data 
Detailed instruction will be updated soon. To change the desired department (now it is scrapping the course information from CCIT department, you just need to change the number that represent the department number in the url. It should be fairly easy to find if you have only a little knowledge).
